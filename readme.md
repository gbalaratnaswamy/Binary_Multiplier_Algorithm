# Integer Multiplier
This repo aim is to explore different types of integer binary multiplication algorithms and implement them in verilog. This includes both unsigned and singed integers represented in 2's complement form.

Following alogrithms are implemented till now:
 * Booth Multiplier
 * Wallace Tree Multiplier
